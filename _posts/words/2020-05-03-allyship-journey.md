      <p><strong>The Allyship Journey</strong></p>
      <p>What the allyship journey looks like: where we start, the wandering path along the way,
        how we can influence others, and whether we ever attain the ubiquitous title of ally.</p>

      <p>Who is this guy, Tod Hilton?</p>
      <p>I’m a technical writer, currently at Google. During my twenty years in technology I’ve
        done the following jobs (so many acronyms): SA, SE, SRE, DBA, SDE/SWE, & SDET.
        In my personal time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, writing, photography,
        traveling, and being a geek/nerd.</p>
      <p>I’m not an expert on allyship, but I have been on the journey for some time and enjoy
        discussing it with others.</p>

      <p>In 1967, Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to officially run the Boston Marathon.
        It wasn’t a grand celebration of the officials finally deciding to allow
        women to participate. Rather, it was a fluke that her registration even
        went through; she had used her initials on the entry forms instead of her
        full name. Besides, the entry forms didn't have a place to specify sex even
        if she had meant to do so.</p>
      <p>While she was running, a race official tried to forcibly remove her, 
        but her boyfriend, Tom Miller, prevented it.</p>
      <p>The director of the Boston Athletic Association, Will Cloney, later said "Women
        can't run in the Marathon because the rules forbid it. Unless we have rules,
        society will be in chaos. I don't make the rules, but I try to carry them out.
        We have no space in the Marathon for any unauthorized person, even a man.
        If that girl were my daughter, I would spank her." Source:

      <p>As you can see, there wasn't any chaos.</p>
      <p>In 1967, Tom Miller and these men displayed allyship towards Kathrine
        Switzer. She finished the race in 4 hours and 20 minutes and went on to become
        a renowned marathon runner and activist.</p>
      <p>In 1972, women were finally allowed to run the Boston Marathon.</p>
      <p>I remember reading about this in 2017, the 50th anniversary of her participation,
        and being flabbergasted that such a rule existed in my lifetime. It reinforced my
        decision to practice allyship more vocally.</p>
      <p>Have you heard the phrase “women’s rights are women’s issues?” Growing up in the
        80’s, that was the lesson I absorbed from society and my peers. I entered adulthood
        with the idea that women's rights weren’t my issue and I shouldn’t do anything.</p>
      <p>How about these maxims: “if you work hard, you’ll succeed”, “we all make our own
        opportunities”, and “pull yourself up by your bootstraps.”</p>
      <p>As a young adult, it began to occur to me that there was a similar problem with all
        of those phrases. They all make an assumption about where we fit in society.
        They’re built around the persona that I embody: a white, cisgender, heterosexual,
        able-bodied, middle-income man. If you're not all of these things (or at least some),
        it becomes increasingly difficult to bring those maxims to reality.</p>
      <p>I'm sure Kathrine Switzer worked hard training for the Boston Marathon. And yet,
        they actively tried to deny her the opportunity to succeed. That decision was made
        by a group of men, because, historically speaking, men are the ones in the positions
        of power.</p>
      <p>This is why men need to be involved in creating equity for people in historically
        excluded groups. These are human issues, not just women’s issues or LGBTQ+ issues
        or racial issues. Men are often the ones in power, controlling the decision-making
        processes.</p>

      <p><strong>My beginning</strong></p>
      <p>Entering adulthood, it began to dawn on me that my experience was different
        from others around me, especially women and people from historically excluded
        groups.</p>
      <p>When I was an inexperienced accountant fresh out of university, I got
        a job as a staff accountant at a small firm and was given a window office on the
        main floor of the building. A few months later, the partners hired a female
        accountant who was a CPA with 20 years of experience. She was given a desk in
        a small, cramped, office upstairs that she shared with another female accountant.
        It didn't make sense to me at the time and I don't recall getting much of an
        explanation when I asked about it.</p>
      <p>I joined tech in the late 90's and noticed there were fewer women in technical
        roles on my teams&mdash;this is often still the case. And when there were women
        on the team, guys often referred to them in subtly unflattering, derisive, or
        misogynistic ways. Being a less experienced member of the teams, I was
        often too nervous or afraid to say anything in those moments.</p>
      <p>As I gained more life and work experience, I realized that I needed to be more
        than a silent supporter.</p>
      <p>Based on my experiences, these are the stages of my allyship journey:
        <ul>
          <li>It's OK to make mistakes</li>
          <li>Build your awareness</li>
          <li>Discuss allyship with others</li>
          <li>Practice allyship & advocacy</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
